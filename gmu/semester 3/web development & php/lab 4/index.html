I guess all i can do is just sulk.<br>Seriously though, what was done last assignment was messed up. I had everything done and just because i decided to not turn in the useless second submission i get a 0<br> i figure i'm pushing my luck too much anyways, i mean who knows maybe i could get in trouble for just being disappointed in a class. I've seen more ridiculous things in my life.<br> Especially at this this school. Don't take this as me being pissed, but instead as me being disappointed in spending 4 hours doing a worthless assignment. But i guess that's assuming this will ever be read.<br> maybe this will just end up as a piece of memory for me to cringe at year later.<br>anyways, make a comment down below on what you think.</p><h3>Add Comments</h3><form action="comment.php" method="post">						Name: <input type="text" name="name" />			<br>			Email: <input type="text" name="email" />			<br>			Comments: <input style ="height:50px" type="text" name="comment" size= "50" />			<br><br>			<input type="submit" value="sign" />			<input type="reset" value = "reset form">		</form>				<a href="comment.php"> View Posting Comments </a></div><div class="copyright">there is nothing that requires a copyright notice</div></body></html>
