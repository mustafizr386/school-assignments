<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Over the years cars have been getting faster, cheaper, and more sophisticated and with those advances they've become more dangerous. Back in the early days of automobiles, cars were very slow and expensive and because of that, they had very few accidents. But as cars got faster and more accessible to the common consumer and building of roads and highways everywhere made the chances of car accidents skyrocket. Because of this car manufactures have been designing technologies to help save lives in case of an accident, and with new technology they're helping avoid accidents from starting in the first place.</p>
